TLDR: I was a developer with an entrepreneurial mindset and came to realize I could contribute much more as a product manager.

Why?

I've been a full-time software developer since 2007 (14 years) and wrote code as a hobby even before that. Throughout my developer career I was constantly not doing "only my job". I always had side projects. Some of these projects even became a paid products that people many people used and loved.

And when I was not working on a side-project my focus was on developing as many product features and bring value as much as possible. As time went on, I began to lose interest in improving my development skills and build environment, for example, I preferred adding another customer facing feature over reducing the time it took to build the mobile app. 

I was always interested in who is using our products, why, and how we can increase the value they get from using the product. I wanted to be closer to the business. 

So for my 40th trip around the sun I was given the opportunity to transition from a software developer to a product manager role at Bringg. This was an ideal fit for the company, as I knew most of the business and knew my way around. This will allow me a soft landing in my new role. I will be able to apply my technical knowledge and experience to the product, as well as my understanding of customer and market needs. I'm looking forward to seeing where this opportunity takes me in the future.
