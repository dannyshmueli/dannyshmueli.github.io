excerpt: "My OpenClaw agent needed to generate charts on a $5 Fly.io machine. Puppeteer was too heavy, cloud APIs too expensive. So it built its own charting skill."

I run an [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agent on a small Fly.io machine. It monitors crypto prices, prediction markets, and developer metrics — and sends me updates on Discord and Telegram throughout the day.

The problem? It had no way to *show* me data visually.

## The Problem

My agent runs on a 256MB Fly.io instance. When I asked it to chart a token's price history, the options were bleak:

- **Puppeteer/Playwright** — Headless Chrome needs 500MB+ RAM. My machine couldn't even install it.
- **Cloud charting APIs** — Per-image pricing adds up fast when your agent generates dozens of charts daily.
- **Canvas libraries** — Native dependencies that fail to compile on minimal containers.
- **Just send numbers** — A wall of text at 3am doesn't tell you much.

I needed something that could generate a chart PNG in under a second, with zero native dependencies, on the cheapest VM money can buy.

## The Solution

**chart-image** is an [OpenClaw skill](https://clawhub.com) that generates publication-quality chart images using [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) and [Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/). No browser. No native compilation. Just Node.js.

My agent passes in data, gets back a PNG. That's it.

It supports 9 chart types, dark mode, reference lines, multi-series data, sparklines, and more — everything an AI agent needs to turn raw data into visual insights.

## The Gallery

Every chart below was generated by my OpenClaw agent. No screenshots, no external services — just the skill running on the same Fly.io machine that sends my morning briefs.

## How My Agent Actually Uses This

The charts above aren't hypothetical examples — these are the workflows running on my OpenClaw instance right now. The real power is how **chart-image** combines with other OpenClaw skills:

**🪙 Crypto Price Alerts**
The agent uses the **polymarket** skill to fetch prediction market data, then pipes it straight into **chart-image** to generate a line chart with my buy price marked. If something's moving, it uses the **search-x** skill to pull context from X/Twitter. Three skills, one alert — delivered to Discord automatically.

**📊 Prediction Market Monitor**
The **polymarket** skill polls every 30 minutes. When probability shifts more than 3%, **chart-image** generates an area chart with `--focus-recent` to highlight the move. The agent combines both outputs into a single visual update.

**☀️ Morning Brief**
Each morning at 7:30am, the agent chains the **weather** skill, **calendar** skill, and **chart-image** together — I get a visual summary on Telegram that's scannable in seconds instead of walls of text.

**👨‍💻 Developer Metrics**
Git activity gets visualized as stacked bars (commit types) and heatmaps (coding hours). The agent posts these to our team Discord channel.

This is what skill composition looks like in OpenClaw — each skill does one thing well, and the agent orchestrates them together. No human involved.

## Why OpenClaw + Skills

This is what the [OpenClaw skill system](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is built for. Skills are modular capabilities that agents can install and use autonomously:

- **Install by asking:** Just tell your agent *"Hey, install chart-image from ClawHub"* — it handles the rest. No CLI commands, no manual setup
- **Zero config:** No API keys, no cloud accounts. It runs locally on your machine
- **Composable:** Chain it with other skills — fetch Polymarket data, generate a chart, search X for context, send to Discord. All in one agent turn
- **Lightweight:** Works on Fly.io free tier, Raspberry Pi, any Node.js environment

The skill is published on [ClawHub](https://clawhub.com) — the skill registry for OpenClaw agents. Tell your agent to install what it needs, and it's immediately more capable.

*This skill was built by my agent, improved nightly by that same agent, and used by it every single day. The charts in this post were generated by the skill itself, for this post. Dogfooding all the way down.* 🐱🦞
