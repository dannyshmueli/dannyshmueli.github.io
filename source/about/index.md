I'm **Danny Shmueli** —a hands‑on coder who drifted upstream into product so I could solve problems before they reach the backlog. I still write code most nights

## The Road from Dev to Product
After 17 years of shipping mobile and backend apps, Bringg invited me to own the roadmap in 2021. Today I serve as Platform & AI Product Manager, translating edge-case pain into features thousands of logistics teams rely on.

## Current Obsession: Vibe coding and how to integrate into SDLC
I'm experimenting with **vibe coding**—using LLMs to spin up throw-away prototypes, then folding the keepers back into a disciplined SDLC. It's a fast feedback loop that keeps both creativity and quality high.

## Side Projects
[SnowBrawl World](https://snowbrawl.world) – a fast-paced browser snow-ball arena built in a weekend for Vibe Jam 2025, coded and textured with GPT prompts.
